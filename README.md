# Gulp Config Files

This is the latest version of my current Gulp development setup.

It's provided here to help fellow and new developers make the leap from GUI pre-compilers like Prepros to command line.

# Why Use Gulp Over GUI Compilers?

There are several advantages...

* Extremely powerful customization -- you can design a setup to suit your specific style or project.  (It's like having an app for almost everything.)
* Large and long term community support. (New plugins are designed often and are easily available.)
* Avoid RAM hogging, frozen precompiler issues that require you to force quit.  (With Terminal you simply cut off the problem with a single keystroke.)
